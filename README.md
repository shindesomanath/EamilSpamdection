# Email Spam Detection Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to detect spam emails using various data processing and classification techniques. The solution is developed in Jupyter Notebook and is intended for educational, demonstration, and practical purposes.

## Features

- Data loading, preprocessing, and exploration
- Feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, Bag of Words)
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest)
- Performance metrics visualization (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- Prediction on new samples

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shindesomanath/EamilSpamdection.git
cd EamilSpamdection
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Prepare the Dataset

- Download a spam email dataset (e.g., [Kaggle SMS Spam Collection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset))
- Place it in the `data/` folder as `spam.csv`
- Update the notebook if your filename or columns differ

### 4. Run the Notebook

Open the main notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/main.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions and run the cells step by step.

## Usage

- Explore the dataset and visualize spam vs. non-spam distributions
- Train the model and tweak hyperparameters
- Evaluate the model using various metrics
- Predict spam probability for new email samples

## Results

- Achieves competitive accuracy on standard datasets
- Shows clear separation between spam and ham (non-spam) emails
- Visualizes confusion matrix and ROC curves
